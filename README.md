### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1709024152/89689/cool-doge.gif?1709024152" width="25"/>

Iâ€™m **Albert**, a designer trying to learn how to code.

My passion is to design functional projects and create visual appealing interfaces that generate more engagement!

I want to learn how to code properly so I can make my prototypes feel alive (also being able to tell the devs that this crazy design is posible hehe). Outside of the design/tech world you will see me playing League of Legends, hit the gym four times a week and enjoying a film or a series with popcorns with my fiance.

#### Fun Facts:

* I love specialty coffee but I'm a sugar addict.
* I have more than 2000 hours in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
